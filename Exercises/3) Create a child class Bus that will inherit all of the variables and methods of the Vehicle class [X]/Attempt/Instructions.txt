Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class

Given:


class Vehicle:

    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage


Create a Bus object that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the parent Vehicle class and display it.
