Create a Bus class that inherits from the Vehicle class. Give the capacity argument of Bus.seating_capacity() a default value of 50.

Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class:



class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

    def seating_capacity(self, capacity):
        return f"The seating capacity of a {self.name} is {capacity} passengers"




Expected Output:

"The seating capacity of a bus is 50 passengers"
